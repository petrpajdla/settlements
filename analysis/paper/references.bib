  abstract = {The object of the paper is to update the current concept of the chronology of the Neolithic (c. 5400\textendash 3300 BC) of the Czech Republic and northern Lower Austria by comparing the typo-chronological development of pottery and modelling the corresponding radiocarbon dates. Up until now, pottery and its style have often been perceived in Central Europe as ``basic indicators'' of archaeological cultures or pottery traditions, which are then further divided into chronological stages and phases. And yet, an analysis of the relationships of all three levels of these entities in the context of four types of models of radiocarbon dates indicates that changes in the original material culture do not necessarily occur on a time axis. While it is true that archaeological cultures have proven to be the robust materialisation of primarily chronological trends valid in larger geographic areas, at the level of general and more detailed pottery groups, development can be manifested in other ways (regionally, socially or in a way that is difficult to interpret).

  abstract = {An in-depth analysis of urban road network distribution plays a critical role in understanding the urbanization process. However, effective ways to quantitatively analyze the spatial paradigms of road networks are still lacking, and few studies have utilized road networks to rapidly identify urban areas of a region. Thus, using a fast-developing region in the south-eastern costal region of China, Fuzhou City, as a case, we introduced kernel density estimation (KDE) to characterize road networks and quantified the area\&rsquo;s spatial heterogeneity using exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and semivariance analysis (SA). The results show that there is an uneven spatial distribution of the networks both at the regional and downtown levels. At the regional level, there is a conspicuous polarization in the road distribution, with the KDE being much higher in the urban areas than in the rural areas; at the downtown level, the KDE gradually decreases from the center to the periphery. Quantitatively, the ranges of the spatial dependence of the networks are approximately 25 km for the entire study region and 12 km for the downtown area. Additionally, the spatial variations vary among different directions, with greater variations in the northeast\&ndash;southwest and the southeast\&ndash;northwest directions compared with the other directions, which is in line with the urban sprawl policy of the study area. Both the qualitative and quantitative results show that the distribution of road networks has a clear urban\&ndash;rural dual structure, which indicates that road networks can be an active tool in identifying the urban areas of a region. To this end, we propose a quick and easy method to delimit urban areas using KDE. The extraction results of KDE are better than those of the index-based built-up index (IBI), indicating the effectivity and feasibility of our proposed method to identify the urban areas in the region. This research sheds new light on urbanization development research.},

  abstract = {The use of computers and complex software is pervasive in archaeology, yet their role in the analytical pipeline is rarely exposed for other researchers to inspect or reuse. This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other's work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.},

  abstract = {In the dissertation I study the settlement and distribution structures during the existence of the LBK, the SBK and the Lengyel pottery styles. From theoretical standpoint I came out from the polythetic theory and the theory of archaeological subcultures by D.L. Clarke. The concept of archaeological culture follows critiques by M. Furholt a P. Kv\v{e}tina and is not used here. Distribution structures are studied based on C. Renfrew's theory (e.g. 1969). Each settlement site is described by pottery types whose division is understood in terms of relative chronologies, but without the prior of time relation. The time range of particular pottery groups is defined according to the analysis of calibrated C14 dates related to this pottery groups. The study of settlement structures is divides into two parts: relation of the sites with chosen aspects of the environment (elevation, slope exposure and slope scale) and social relations (kernel density, linear organisation of the sites, hierarchical relationship among sites, number of sites and settlement continuity and social boundaries). Distribution structures of the chipped and polished stone industries are analysed based on proportional and positive occurrence of particular raw materials at sites defined by pottery groups and based on spatial distribution. In the interpretation I define LBK pottery style as isochrestic because most of the analysed aspects is not differing for particular LBK pottery groups. By contrast, the pottery in the post-LBK period is characterised as emblematic style which actively follows social structure.},
